Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders that affect mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of the cell. Some well-known examples include MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers), Leigh syndrome, and Kearns-Sayre syndrome. These conditions cause a wide range of symptoms, affecting many organs, and can lead to issues like muscle weakness, vision loss, and developmental delays. 
Common mitochondrial diseases include;
MELAS syndrome is Characterized by a combination of stroke-like episodes, seizures, and lactic acidosis.
MERRF syndrome involves myoclonic epilepsy, which causes muscle twitching, along with other symptoms like ataxia (coordination problems) and myopathy (muscle weakness).
Leigh syndrome is a serious neurological disorder that primarily affects infants and leads to progressive loss of movement and neurocognitive abilities.
Kearns-Sayre syndrome often starts before age 20 and affects the eyes (ocular myopathy, ptosis), heart (cardiac conduction defects), and nervous system.
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a type of mitochondrial disease that causes a rapid loss of vision in the optic nerve.
