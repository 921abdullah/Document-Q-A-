The main function of mitochondria is to generate metabolic energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the process of oxidative phosphorylation. They convert chemical energy from food into ATP, which powers most cellular activities. Mitochondria also have other critical roles, such as regulating calcium levels, heat production, and managing cell death (apoptosis)
